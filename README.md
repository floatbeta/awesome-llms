# Awesome LLMS.txt Files

A curated collection of LLMS.txt files for APIs, Services, and Apps that don't have official ones.

## What is LLMS.txt?

LLMS.txt is a standardized markdown format that helps Large Language Models (LLMs) understand and work with documentation for APIs, services, and applications. These files provide concise, structured information that LLMs can quickly parse and use to assist developers.

## Repository Structure

```

## Available LLMS.txt Files

### APIs
- **WebGPU** (`apis/webgpu-llms.txt`) - Modern GPU API for the web

## How to Use

These LLMS.txt files can be used to provide context to LLMs when working with the respective technologies. You can:

1. **Direct Reference**: Copy the content and provide it as context to an LLM
2. **Local Development**: Include these files in your project documentation
3. **LLM Tools**: Use with LLM-powered development tools that support the LLMS.txt format
